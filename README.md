# ArduinoStroboscope

Inspired by and based off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TiJvN_NIQc">William Osman's Stroboscope Design</a>.

<b>How it works:</b>
<br>
An <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> controls a mosfet that switches a 10W LED on and off at a specified frequency. The frequency of the strobe can be adjusted using a rotary encoder and two buttons. The stroboscope is powered by a 3S lipo battery which is wired to a boost converter that regulates the output voltage and current.
